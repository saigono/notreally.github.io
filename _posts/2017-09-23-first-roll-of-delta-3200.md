my momma always said,
> life was like a new roll of film. you never know what you’re gonna get.

or it wasn't my ma.

nevertheless, to me new roll of film = excitement. i've never tried to shoot such a fast film as ilford delta 3200. even with digital cameras, i try to cap my iso at 800. but this time i decided to experiment a little bit.

and failed.

well, you can't find word "reasonable" in my CV. approximately 1/3 of film was shot during the day.

so wrong!
{% include gallery id="gallery1" layout="half" %}

but that's not all. what do you think about daylight grainy out of focus pictures?

{% include gallery id="gallery2" %}

sometimes rules have exceptions, i actually like the next photo
{% include figure image_path="https://live.staticflickr.com/65535/49503466266_ec6d3c64df_k.jpg" %}
let's forget about this daylight photos and move to something made at night.

like really at night.

most of the photos were made at about 2pm.

moscow never sleeps
{% include gallery id="gallery3" %}

as you can see one with a certain level of skill can make some decent photos even with film this fast.

unfortunately, not me.

okay, some shots were good

good-ish

not so bad

but i won't print them
